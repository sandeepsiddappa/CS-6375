## Introduction
This project implements a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for predicting the stock prices of Apple Inc. It showcases the application of RNNs in time series forecasting, focusing on the financial market. The project uses Python, with key libraries including pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Implementation includes data cleaning and normalization.
- **Time Series Preparation**: Transformation of stock price data into a format suitable for time series forecasting.
- **RNN Model**: Custom RNN architecture with various activation functions.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Comprehensive training routine with evaluation metrics such as MSE, R2 Score, and RMSE.
- **Visualization**: Graphical representation of predicted versus actual stock prices and the model's training loss curve.
